The original single-player, single-objective SameGame rewards the player with $n^2$ points for removing any group of $n$ tiles. MO-SameGame can extend this in two ways. Agents can either only get points for their own actions, leading to competition between them, or all rewards can be shared in ``team reward'' mode. Additionally, points for every colour can be counted as separate objectives, allowing for different trade-offs between colours, or they can be accumulated in a single objective like in the default game variant, essentially providing a single-objective wrapper for the game. |
